## üöß Problem Statements & Project Scopes

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Basic YouTube Embed Page
**Problem:**  
YouTube‚Äôs default interface contains distractions that reduce focus.  
**Scope:**  
Build an HTML webpage that embeds a YouTube video, removing related content and links that cause distraction. Use HTML5 elements for structure and presentation.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Improved Layout
**Problem:**  
User feedback showed that the initial layout was not user-friendly.  
**Scope:**  
Refactor the layout using CSS Grid. Create a main video display with a section below it for 4-5 suggested videos.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Theme Toggle Feature
**Problem:**  
Users requested the ability to toggle between light and dark themes.  
**Scope:**  
Implement light (default) and dark themes with a toggle switch styled with icons.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: User Feedback & Theme Persistence
**Problem:**  
We need to track theme requests and retain user preferences.  
**Scope:**  
Add a popup form to collect user data (name, email, theme). Store preferences using Local Storage and restore them on page load.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Full User Profile & Multi-Theme Support
**Problem:**  
Validated user demand for themes requires a full profile system and additional themes.  
**Scope:**  
Create a user profile form capturing name, email, password, and theme. Validate input. Add a navigation menu with "Home" and "Profile" links. Introduce 3+ new themes using radio inputs or toggle buttons.
